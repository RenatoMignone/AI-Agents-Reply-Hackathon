# AI Agents Learning - Reply Code Challenge 2026

This folder contains the tutorial notebooks for the Reply Code Challenge AI Agents learning path.
The notebooks are designed to be read and run in order, progressively building from a basic agent to multi-agent orchestration with Langfuse-based cost tracking.

For context on the overall repository, see the root README.md or AI_Agent.md.

## Contents

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Notebooks/00_AI_Agents.ipynb | Basic LangChain agent creation via OpenRouter |
| Notebooks/01_00_AI_Agents_Tools.ipynb | Extending agents with custom tools using @tool |

## Local Setup

### 1. Create and activate the virtual environment

A local .venv is already initialized in this folder with all required packages.

```bash
# From the 00_AI_Agents_Learning folder:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you need to recreate it from scratch:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install langchain langchain-openai langgraph python-dotenv langfuse ulid-py jupyter ipykernel
```

### 2. Configure your credentials

Copy your keys into the .env file in this folder before running any notebook:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-your-public-key-here
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-your-secret-key-here
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://challenges.reply.com/langfuse
TEAM_NAME=your-team-name
```

| Variable | Where to get it |
|----------|----------------|
| OPENROUTER_API_KEY | openrouter.ai - Keys - Create Key |
| LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY | Provided by the challenge organizers |
| LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY | Provided by the challenge organizers |
| LANGFUSE_HOST | https://challenges.reply.com/langfuse (fixed value) |
| TEAM_NAME | Your team name, used to prefix session IDs |

### 3. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook Notebooks/
```

## Notebook Order

Run the notebooks in sequence. Each one builds on the previous:

1. 00_AI_Agents.ipynb - Create your first agent with a system prompt via OpenRouter
2. 01_00_AI_Agents_Tools.ipynb - Add a temperature conversion tool; learn the @tool decorator
3. 02_Multi_Agents.ipynb - Build a travel planner with Logistics and Recommendations specialists
4. 03_Agent_Resource_Management.ipynb - Integrate Langfuse; track tokens, costs, and latency

Each notebook includes:
- Markdown explanation cells with concepts, architecture descriptions, and design rationale
- Executable code cells that are ready to run and self-contained
- Inline pip install commands so no external requirements.txt is needed

## Notes

The .env file must live in this folder for load_dotenv() to find it automatically.
The .venv directory is local and must not be committed (it is in .gitignore).
For the challenge, always use Langfuse session IDs to group all resource usage for a single run. Session IDs follow the format {TEAM_NAME}-{ULID}.
All notebooks use gpt-4o-mini via OpenRouter as the default model. You can change the model parameter to experiment with other whitelisted models.
